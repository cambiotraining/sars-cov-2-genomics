Under development

:::

Several studies demonstrate a high correlation between wastewater incidence and clinical sampling:

- [Predicting COVID-19 Incidence Using Wastewater Surveillance Data, Denmark, October 2021â€“June 2022](https://doi.org/10.3201/eid2908.221634)
- [Wastewater-Based Surveillance Is an Effective Tool for Trending COVID-19 Prevalence in Communities: A Study of 10 Major Communities for 17 Months in Alberta](https://doi.org/10.1021%2Facsestwater.2c00143)
- [Computational analysis of SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 surveillance by wastewater-based epidemiology locally and globally: Feasibility, economy, opportunities and challenges](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138875)
  - Computational modelling of factors affecting WBE
  - 

For lineage relative abundance estimates: 

- [Correlation between Clinical and Wastewater SARS-CoV-2 Genomic Surveillance, Oregon, USA](https://doi.org/10.3201%2Feid2809.220938)

Cons:

- Heterogenous samples 
  - challenges in protocols for concentrating/cleaning the material
- RNA degradation
  - During travel time in the sewage system
  - Seasonal temperature - not adjusting for seasonal variation can lead to very misleading figures (that's why normalisation with an independent marker is essential)
- Requires access to central wastewater collection systems (wastewater treatment plants). Not suitable for populations using septic tanks or lacking access to sewage systems.


Two main methods of WBE:

- Incidence: RT-qPCR
- Relative lineage abundance: WGS

The two methods are complementary. 
There is no easy way to estimate the incidence of the virus based on sequencing data alone. 
Conversely, there is no way to determine the variants present in a sample using RT-qPCR. 

The two methods can be used independently (depending on the objectives of the monitoring) or in combination with each other. 
For example, the relative lineage abundance can be converted to viral numbers if RT-qPCR data is available to do that calculation.


## Sample preparation

The virus is very diluted. 
Therefore, an important step is required where the virus is concentrated in the sample. 
There are several methods, none of which is deemed the "best". 
Different methods may work better or worse for different samples and situations. 
Also depends on resources available (equipment and reagents).
